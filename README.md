### Introducing  

![Semmelweis](https://img-s1.onedio.com/id-575aa86599d6c333582bae7b/rev-0/w-620/f-jpg/s-856e7addf04f4b11b582f95dde3f58b64568ad0c.jpg)

This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands  

In this project, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.

### Read Map  
You should start with `exploring.ipynb` to examine the notebooks. You will understand the data and u will be explored the data.  

When you finish that keep going with `bootstrap_analysis.ipynb` notebook. On that notebook you will see the bootstrap analysis and confirming the hypothesis.
